### Overview
Through this website, I aimed to showcase the exciting aspects of being part of Delta Hacks, highlighting the skills of web development and the importance of knowledge sharing within the community. The design incorporates a hacker aesthetic to reflect the innovative spirit of the hackathon.

### Features
- **Hacker Aesthetic Design**: A visually engaging layout that captures the essence of the hackathon experience.
